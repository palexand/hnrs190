1. Use online and library resource to find out what a Turing Machine
   is.  What does it represent?  Why is it important?  Is it really a
   "machine"?  How does it relate to the Halting Problem? 
2. Choose one of your professors and pay them a visit during office
   hours.  (I don't count for this assignment.)
