The Freshman Honors Tutorial is a one hour class introducing freshman honors program students to research and KU.  My section looks at the early days of computing focusing on how computing came to be and why.  We look at work by the major early computing scholars and put their work in the context of World War II.  We also look a that the limitations of computing and what we know about what can and cannot be computed mechanically.
