Your semester writing assignment is a 3-5 page essay that will include:

* a topic overview
* a literature survey
* an annotated bibliography 

The topic overview will outline the general topic of your paper.  The literature survey and bibliography will contain 3-5 papers outlining their connection to your chosen topic.  Think about a 3-5 page introduction that I could hand to next year's tutorial students to introduce the topic that you choose.

Your topic should be one of the following:

* Outline the intellectual connections between Hilbert, Goedel, and Turing
* Outline the social aspects of Turing's homosexuality
* Outline the connections between Chomsky's language hierarchy and automata

You may propose another topic if you are so interested.

Note that 3-5 pages is a serious restriction.  Not one word shorter or longer!

I have created a submission page on Blackboard if you want to use it.  Altermatively, you can email me your final paper.
