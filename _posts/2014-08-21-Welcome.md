Welcome to my Honors 190 blog. We will be looking at the origins of computing starting in the early 1900s with David Hilbert through Alan Turing's work in the 1930s.  We will also talk about scholarship and how to survive and thrive at the University.  Our tutorial assistant is Ashley Farris who will help with all things related to the honors program.
