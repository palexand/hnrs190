# HNRS 190 - Freshman Honors Tutorial

The Freshman Honors Tutorial is a one hour class introducing freshman
honors program students to research and KU.  My section looks at the
early days of computing focusing on how computing came to be and
why. We look at work by the major early computing scholars and put
their work in the context of World War II.  We also look a that the
limitations of computing and what we know about what can and cannot be
computed mechanically.

# Projects and Homework

Projects and homework will be due on approximately a weekly
basis. Unless otherwise noted, projects and homework are due at the
beginning of the class period indicated on the web page.  If the due
date is a holiday and KU offices are closed, the due date becomes the
next class period.  Late homework assignments are not accepted.  You
must turn in 70% of your assignments on time to receive a passing
grade in the course.  If you have a valid excuse for being late, a new
due date will be assigned.

Please submit your projects and homework using the KU Canvas
system.  I will not accept paper listings.

# Web Repository

---- 

All project and homework assignments, exams, solutions and handouts
you receive in class are linked to the [HNRS 190 homepage]({{ site.url

general, I will not distribute hard copies of assignments in
class. All documents will be published using the Adobe PDF standard.

# Classroom Policies

---- 

#### The Three Commandments

Pretty simple.  Follow them and we'll be great friends!

1. Don't whine
1. Don't cheat
1. Don't tell me what you don't need to know

#### COVID Accommodations

In the classroom we will follow requirements from The University and
State.  Currently masks are not required to attend class or office
hours.  However, if you prefer that I wear a mask during an office
hours visit, please let me know and I will.  I am also willing to do
office hours by zoom.  The class will _not_ be available via zoom. 

#### Class Participation

I do not take attendance in class; however participation in class is important
to its success. How much homework and how rigorously it is graded will
definitely depend on class participation. Please ask questions and
participate in class discussions. When assigning final grades,
borderline cases will be decided based on class participation.

#### Grading Errors

If I have made an error in grading an exam or assignment, you have two
weeks following the date the item is available to see me about
correcting the problem. Note that this includes the final! After that
time, your grade is set and will not be changed. I also request that
you wait 24 hours after an exam is returned before coming to me with
questions.

#### Curving

I may decide to curve final scores when the quarter is over. Whether I
curve and how much I curve is at my discretion. I will never curve up,
but may curve down. Specifically, 90% and above will always be an "A",
but I may choose to lower the cutoff percentage. Whether I curve and
how much I curve is at my discretion. I will never curve scores on an
individual graded assignment, lab or exam. 

#### Email

I encourage you to use email to contact me. I am logged in whenever I
am working and check my mail frequently. Email is my preferred means
of communication. 

#### Blog

The course blog is available on the [website](blog.html). I will post
late-breaking news about projects, homework and class administration
on the blog. Check the website and blog frequently, particularly
around project due dates and exams. 

#### Phone

Feel free to call me in any of my office at any time. I would prefer
not to be called at home. 

#### Office Hours

I will make every effort to be in my office during scheduled office
hours. If there are exceptions, I will let you know as early as is
possible. If you have a conflict with my office hours, please make an
appointment. I have an open door policy, you are free to come by
whenever you choose. If I am busy, I may ask that you come back later,
but please don't hesitate to knock!

#### Cheating

Academic misconduct of any kind will automatically result in a 0 score
on the homework, lab, project, or exam in question and your actions
will be reported to the department chair. Your homework, exams and
projects must be individually prepared unless otherwise noted. Posting
your assignments to internet discussion lists is considered academic
misconduct. Sharing your solutions with others is considered academic
misconduct. Turning in solutions from previous semesters is considered
academic misconduct. Paying people to prepare solutions is academic
misconduct. Automated mechanisms are available for checking the
originality of source code. Please spend your time trying to solve
assigned problems rather than trying to get around the system. Don't
risk it!  

#### Excuses

Excusing a missed exam or assignment is left to the discretion of the
instructor. Illness, family emergencies, and religious observances are
examples of acceptable excuses. Computer down time, over sleeping, and
social events are examples of unacceptable excuses. Please try to let
me know of problems in advance when possible and be prepared to
provide verification of your excuse.  

#### Extensions

As a policy, I do not extend due dates of homework and projects. If I
choose to do so, I will only announce the extension in class, via
email or on the blog. If you hear an extension has been granted and I
have not announced it, your information is incorrect. Remember that if
I grant extensions early in the semester, it will necessarily compress
due dates the end of the semester.  

#### Dress Code

Ties are expressly forbidden in my classroom.  If you wear one you
will be taunted mercilessly.  Exceptions are made for bow ties which
we all know are cool. 

# Grading

---- 

Grades are assigned on a standard 10 point scale:

* A = 90-100%
* B = 80-90%
* C = 70-80%
* F = 0-70%

Classroom tasks are weighted using the following scale

* Class Participation 40%
* Homework and Mini Projects 60%

# Topics

---- 

The course structure is quite loose and we will tend to go wherever
our discussions take us.

* Formal Systems and Hilbert's Problems
* Propositional and Predicate Calculus
* Goedel's Inconsistency Result
* Language and Computing
* Turing, Turing Machines and Halting
* Turing and Codebreaking
